## Model, Prompts & Improvements

### Model Used
We used **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the core AI model for Code Breaker.  
This model was selected because it provides:
- **Lightning-fast responses** optimized for real-time coding help  
- **Strong contextual understanding** across multiple programming languages  
- **Accurate code generation** with minimal syntax errors  
- **Efficient reasoning** for explaining, refactoring, and debugging code  

**Gemini 2.5 Flash** was the ideal choice for Code Breaker‚Äôs focus on **speed, precision, and developer-friendly assistance**.

---

### Prompt Structure

Our prompts were carefully designed to guide the AI toward clear, relevant, and consistent outputs.  
Each prompt includes:

1. **Role Definition** ‚Äì Instructs the AI to act solely as a *code-focused assistant*  
2. **Context Input** ‚Äì Captures the user‚Äôs exact request, question, or error message  
3. **Instruction Control** ‚Äì Directs the AI to produce *clean, formatted code* and concise explanations  
4. **Output Formatting** ‚Äì Ensures all code snippets use proper syntax highlighting and markdown blocks  

**Example Prompt Structure:**

- Direct and Short Prompts: Users typically input concise queries like:
  - basic algorithms
  - basic SQL syntax
  - basic python syntax
  - basic R syntax
- Expecting Educational Output: The prompts are framed to request explanations, examples, or syntax overviews.
- Implicit Context: The AI seems to rely on the context of the prompt and previous chats to determine the type of response (coding help).

---

### Limitations

While **Gemini 2.5 Flash** performs exceptionally well, a few current limitations remain:
- Cannot execute or test code directly ‚Äî provides only text-based responses  
- Occasional inconsistencies in **explanation depth** based on user phrasing  
- Relies on **prompt clarity** for best performance  

---

### Improvements Made

To enhance Code Breaker‚Äôs accuracy and reliability, we implemented several refinements:
- Re-engineered prompt templates to enforce **code-only responses**  
- Filtered outputs to fix **HTML rendering issues** (so headers don‚Äôt appear in the webpage UI)  
- Improved follow-up handling for **contextual multi-turn questions**  
- Optimized formatting for **readability and syntax accuracy**

## Vision

To create an open-source, intelligent assistant that empowers coders to learn, create, and solve problems faster ‚Äî without ever leaving their workspace.
